It can also refer to the experience of mastering these technologies and using them together.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Consensus Mechanism ：**</font>The so-called "consensus mechanism" is to complete the verification and confirmation of the transaction in a short time through the voting of special nodes;For a transaction, if several nodes with unrelated interests can reach a consensus, we can think that the whole network can reach a consensus on this.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Token：**</font>Token is a kind of certificate of rights and interests in digital form, which represents a kind of right, an inherent and intrinsic value. Token can represent all rights and interests proof that can be digitized, from ID card to diploma, from currency to bill, from key, ticket to points, card coupon, from stock to bond, account, ownership, qualification, certificate and other all rights and interests proof of human society, can be represented with token.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Open Source Code：**</font>Open source code, also known as source code disclosure, refers to a software release mode. Generally, only compiled binary executable files can be obtained for general software, and only the author or copyright owner of the software owns the original code of the program. Some software authors will disclose the source code, which is called "source code disclosure". However, this does not necessarily conform to the definition and conditions of "open source code", because the author may set restrictions on the conditions for the disclosure of source code, such as restricting the objects of readable source code, restricting derivatives, etc.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**DAPP：**</font>DAPP refers to distributed application or decentralized application. DAPP in blockchain is just like app in IOS and Android.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Full Node：**</font>Full node is a node with complete blockchain ledger,It needs to occupy memory to synchronize all the blockchain data. It can independently verify all transactions on the blockchain and update the data in real time. It is mainly responsible for broadcasting and verifying the transactions of the blockchain.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Miner Node：**</font>It refers to the node set to the mining state. The node in the mining state needs to contribute computing power, and has the opportunity to be selected as the write node to participate in the generation of new blocks and maintain the growth of the chain.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Mining：**</font>The so-called mining in the blockchain is different from the mining in our daily life. It refers to the nickname of the exploration method to obtain digital currency in the blockchain network. Because the number of coins is limited, and this behavior is similar to that of gold mining, so we call the way to obtain digital currency through this 	rule as mining, and those who participate in data processing are called miners.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Port Mapping：**</font>Port mapping is a kind of NAT. Its function is to translate the address in public network into private address. ADSL broadband router with routing mode has a dynamic or fixed public network IP. ADSL is directly connected to the HUB or switch, and all computers share the Internet access.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Environment Variables：**</font>Generally, it refers to some parameters used to specify the operating system operating environment in the operating system, such as the location of temporary folder and system folder. Environment variable is an object with a specific name in the operating system. It contains the information that one or more applications will use. For example, for the path environment variable in Windows and DOS operating systems, when the system is required to run a program without telling it the full path of the program, the system should not only look for the program under the current directory, but also find the path specified in the path. Users can run the process better by setting environment variables.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Java：**</font>Java is an object-oriented programming language. It not only absorbs the advantages of C++ language, but also discards the concepts of multi inheritance and pointer which are difficult to understand in C++. Therefore, Java language has two characteristics: powerful function and easy to use. Java language, as the representative of static object-oriented programming language, perfectly implements the object-oriented theory and allows programmers to carry out complex programming with elegant thinking mode.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Node.js：**</font>Node.js is a JavaScript running environment based on Chrome V8 engine. Node.js uses an event driven, non blocking I/O model.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Csharp：**</font>C# pronounced C Sharp. C# is an object-oriented high-level programming language released by Microsoft, which runs on the .NET Framework and .NET Core (completely open source, cross platform). C# is a safe, stable and simple object-oriented programming language derived from C and C++. It inherits the powerful functions of C and C++ while removing some of their complex features.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Hash：**</font>Hash,  is to convert any length of input (also known as  pre image) into a fixed length output through hash algorithm, and the output is the hash value. This transformation is a kind of compression mapping, that is, the space of hash value is usually much smaller than that of input, and different inputs may be hashed into the same output, so it is impossible to determine the unique input value from the hash value. In short, it is a function that compresses messages of any length into a message digest of a fixed length.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Block Body：**</font>Recording the detailed data generated within a certain period of time, including all transaction records or other information that has been verified in the current block and generated during the block creation process, can be understood as a form of account book.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Block Header：**</font>The block header stores the header information of the block, including the hash value of the previous block (prehash), the hash value of the block body (hash), and timestamp, etc.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Time Stamp：**</font>Time stamp is the data generated by digital signature technology. The object of signature includes original file information, signature parameters, signature time and so on. The time stamp system is used to generate and manage the time stamp. The signature object is digitally signed to generate the time stamp to prove that the original file exists before the signature time.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Public Key：**</font>Public key and private key are a key pair (i.e. a public key and a private key) obtained by an algorithm. The public key is the public part of the key pair, while the private key is the non-public part. Public keys are usually used to encrypt session keys, verify digital signatures, or encrypt data that can be decrypted with the corresponding private key. The key pair obtained by this algorithm can be guaranteed to be unique in the world. When using this key pair, if one key is used to encrypt a piece of data, the other key must be used to decrypt it. For example, if the data is encrypted with the public key, it must be decrypted with the private key. Otherwise, the decryption will not succeed.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Merkle Tree：**</font>Merkle tree is an important data structure of blockchain, its function is to quickly summarize and verify the existence and integrity of block data. Generally speaking, it is a way of hashing a large number of data "blocks". It depends on splitting these data "blocks" into smaller units of data blocks. Each bucket block contains only a few data "blocks". Then each bucket unit data block is hashed again, and the same process is repeated until the remaining total hash number is only 1.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Hard Bifurcation：**</font>Permanent differences occur in the blockchain. After the new consensus rules are released, some nodes that have not been upgraded can not verify the blocks produced by the upgraded nodes, so hard bifurcation usually occurs. A hard bifurcation of the code will change the difficulty level of the mining algorithm.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="黑体" size=4 face="黑体">**Replay Attack：**</font>Replay attacks,  refers to the attacker sending a packet that has been received by the target host to achieve the purpose of cheating the system. It is mainly used in the process of identity authentication to destroy the correctness of authentication. Replay attacks can be carried out by the initiator or by the enemy who intercepts and resends the data. Attackers steal authentication credentials by network monitoring or other methods, and then send them back to the authentication server. Replay attack can happen in any network communication process, which is one of the common attack methods of hackers in the computer world.
