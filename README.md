## 1.1 What is WisdomChain?
```
Let the credit flow unprecedented,let the infinite imagination play,Let the infinite value can be embodied,until every corner of the planet.

                                                                                                                     ——Genesis block message

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WisdomChain (short for "WDC") is a basic public chain which is oriented to business applications.Its functional design is carried out around asset definition, multi signature, conditional payment and certificate storage. Based on the design principles of stable security and multi-party autonomy, a unique implementation of technology stack is introduced in the design of performance, security and system openness.WisdomChain provides a simple and reliable technology implementation mechanism, and has a series of tool chains as application service middleware to reduce the use cost.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the underlying public chain system, WisdomChain is designed around the principles of notarization autonomy, security and reliability. The implementation of the five public chain technology stacks (cryptographic components, consensus mechanism, script system, storage mechanism and account model) is strictly logic verified and mathematically demonstrated. In the process of WisdomChain's architecture design and core technology design, it is also adhering to the goal of carrying credit datalization and data capitalization.

## 1.2 How to use this document?
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through this document, you can get the basic methods of users participating in the Wisdom Chain project. First, to be a node in the network, you need to run a Wisdom Chain Client. Connecting to the network tells you basic information about the network, connection troubleshooting, and blockchain synchronization.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the use of SDK section, a variety of development tools are provided to enable users to develop third-party applications based on the main chain SDK of Wisdom Chain. 

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the following chapters, the core technologies of the five technology stacks are introduced according to the framework of Wisdom Chain, and the implementation steps of smart contract calling procedures such as asset definition, multi signature and conditional payment are explained in detail.

##  1.3 Foundation Introduction
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Foundation profile:WisdomChainFoundationLtd. (short for WDCF) is a non-profit organization approved by ACRA (ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY).

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WDCF is headquartered in Singapore and its operation center is in Bangkok, Thailand, WDCF is committed to promoting the development of blockchain technology, disseminating blockchain knowledge, promoting the combination of WisdomChain blockchain technology and real industry, using WisdomChain blockchain technology to improve the competitiveness of enterprises, promoting the development and application of WisdomChain blockchain technology in various industries around the world, and finally realizing the use of blockchain technology to promote economic development and improve people's quality of life. After the public chain of WisdomChain goes online, it is deployed in the form of community autonomy. Its safe and stable operation and revenue depend on many nodes deployed in the world!
